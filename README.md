# Hello

To run the project, open the command line in this folder and use the command 'npm run start:server' in one terminal, and 'npm run start:app' in another. I'm quite unfamiliar with the Angular CLI, so for inspection purposes I hope using the non-production development server (the one typically started using 'ng serve') is alright! I know ideally this wouldn't have to be run from two terminals, as in a live environment the application would be served from a specific path in the RESTful API.

Let me know if there are any problems, I think my Git understanding has gotten rusty and there could definately be some problems I'm not seeing!

Thank you,
Ryuji Komai
